Currently, the model can be used with the following backbones:

1. ResNet50
2. ResNet101
3. ResNet50V2
4. ResNet101V2
5. DenseNet121
6. DenseNet169
7. MobileNet
8. MobileNetV2
9. VGG16
10. VGG19

In my experiments, I found that using `ConvNeXtSmall`, `ConvNeXtTiny`, `ConvNeXtBase`, and `ConvNeXtLarge` as backbones were ineffective.
