# DeepLabV3Plus-TF-Backbones (Under Construction üõ†Ô∏è)

This repository extends the Keras example code for [Multiclass semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3+](https://keras.io/examples/vision/deeplabv3_plus/). While the original example utilized a ResNet50 backbone, my work focuses on adapting the network to support various backbones available in `tensorflow.keras.applications`.


Currently, the model can be used with the following backbones:

1. ResNet50
2. ResNet101
3. ResNet50V2
4. ResNet101V2
5. DenseNet121
6. DenseNet169
7. MobileNet
8. MobileNetV2
9. VGG16
10. VGG19

In my experiments, I found that using `ConvNeXtSmall`, `ConvNeXtTiny`, `ConvNeXtBase`, `ConvNeXtLarge`, and  `EfficientNetB0-B7` as backbones were ineffective.
